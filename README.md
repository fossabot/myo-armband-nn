## Requirement
**Library** | **Version**
--- | ---
**Python** | **^3.5**
**Tensorflow** | **^1.1.0** 
**Numpy** | **^1.12.0**
**sklearn** |  **^0.18.1**
**[myo-python](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python)** |  **^0.2.2**


## Collecting data
You can use your own scripts for collecting EMG data from Myo armband.
But you need to push 64-value array with data from each sensor.<br />
By default myo-python returns 8-value array from each sensors.
Each output return by 2-value array: ```[datetime, [EMG DATA]]```.<br />
64 - value array its 8 output from armband. Just put it to one dimension array.
So you just need to collect 8 values with gesture from armband (if you read data 10 times/s its not a problem).

In repo are collected dataset from Myo armband collected by me. Dataset contains only 5 gestures:
```
üëç - Ok    (1)
‚úäÔ∏è - Fist  (2)
‚úåÔ∏è - Like  (3)
ü§ò - Rock  (4)
üññ - Spock (5)
```

## Training network
```sh
python3 train.py
```
75k iteration will take about 20 min on GTX 960 or 2h on i3-6100.

## Prediction
### Prediction on data from MYO armband
```sh
python3 predict.py
```
You must have installed MYO SDK.
Script will return number (0-5) witch represent gesture (0 - relaxed arm).

### Prediction on test dataset
```sh
python3 predict_test_dataset.py
```
Example output:
```
Accuracy on Test-Set: 80.00% (12 / 15)
[2 1 0 0 0] (0) Relax
[0 3 0 0 0] (1) Ok
[0 0 3 0 0] (2) Fist
[0 0 2 1 0] (3) Like
[0 0 0 0 3] (4) Rock
 (0) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

```
